# The DbDoc Community Code of Conduct

**Note:** DbDoc Code of Conduct is based on the [Ruby's CoC](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/conduct/) which, in turn, is based on an early proposed draft of [the PostgreSQL CoC](https://www.postgresql.org/about/policies/coc/).

This document provides a few simple guidelines for a safe, respectful,
productive, and collaborative place for any person who is willing to contribute
to the DbDoc gem. It applies to all "collaborative spaces", which are Github issues, PRs, commit messages, emails, etc.

* Participants will be tolerant of opposing views.
* Participants must ensure that their language and actions are free of personal attacks and disparaging personal remarks.
* When interpreting the words and actions of others, participants should always assume good intentions.
* Behaviour which can be reasonably considered harassment will not be tolerated.
